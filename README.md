Connect your things to a social network.
Hi all! I always wanted to bring sensors on a social network. This project is a basic implementation of what can later give rise to a dedicated social network for sensors. Have you ever wonder how would it be if all your inanimate things can talk on social network like Facebook, twitter? Green-house updating it’s health on it’s timeline? This project is an effort to give social life to the “things”.
